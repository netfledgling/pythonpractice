# Python Practice
This is a place where I'll be storing whatever code I'm working on as part of my Python programming practice.

I'll be categorizing problems based on where the problem is sourced from.
Folders and sub-folders are:
- Competitive Programming
  - CodeForces
- Job Hunt
  - LeetCode
  - HackerRank
- Textbooks
  - Python Crash Course
  - How to Think like a Computer Scientist (tlacs)
- Misc (for anything that may not apply to aforementioned categories)

The actual code files can be navigated to within the respective folders.
